        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part
            limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
            feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical
            delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for
            us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a
            few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from
            this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all
            living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
